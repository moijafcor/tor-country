# tor-country
A script to manually set the exit country for the Tor Browser.

### WARNING: 

The Tor Project devs don't like the idea of changing entry/exit nodes.

Use this script if you know what you are doing and at your own risk.

> We recommend you do not use these — they are intended for testing and may disappear in future versions. 
> You get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit nodes can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand.
