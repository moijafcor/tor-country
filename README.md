# tor-country
A script to manually set the exit country for [Tor](https://www.torproject.org).

### WARNING: 

The Tor Project devs don't like the idea of users changing entry/exit nodes.

> We recommend you do not use these â€” they are intended for testing and may disappear in future versions. 
> You get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit nodes can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand. 
> 
> [Tor FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ChooseEntryExit)

Use this script if you know what you are doing and at your own risk.
